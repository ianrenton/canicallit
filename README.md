Can I Call It...?
=================

"Can I Call It...?" is a simple script for checking if the name you'd like for your new, shiny project has already been used by somebody else.

It uses project data from [Github][1], [SourceForge][2], [Ruby Gems][3], [PyPI][4] and [Maven][5]. (Only Github repositories with >5 forks are considered 'significant' enough to worry about.)

It was written by [Ian Renton][6]. Source code is available under the [BSD licence][7].
